# LISA Simulator Documentation - Staging Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as the staging area for the LISA Simulator Documentation website. It's designed as the primary platform for integrating and testing changes before they go live on the public-facing site.

## Workflow

1. **Making Changes**: All modifications intended for the public website should initially be made in this repository. This includes content updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes.

2. **Deployment to Staging Site**: Once changes are committed here, they are automatically deployed to a non-public-facing staging site hosted on GitHub Pages. This environment is used for final review and verification of functionality.

3. **Finalizing Changes**:
   - After thorough testing and confirmation that the changes work as expected on the staging site, use the GitHub Action `___` (provide the exact name of the GitHub Action).
   - This action will merge the changes into the `LISA-Documentation` main repository, updating the live public website.
