<p><strong>General Relativity and Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p><strong>Session 4: Curved Spacetimes</strong></p>
<h2 id="SOver">Overview of this Session</h2>
<p>In the last section, we developed the tools for writing tensor equations for physical laws in an arbitrary spacetime (whether curved or flat) using arbitrary coordinates. But as we discussed in Session 1, the real (that is, frame-independent) part of gravity is reflected by the <em>curvature</em> of spacetime. Therefore, if we want to write tensor equations that describe gravity, we need some mathematical tool that is able to distinguish a curved spacetime from a flat spacetime, no matter what weird coordinate system we might be using.</p>
<p>This is not a trivial task. One cannot simply look at the metric and tell whether it describes a curved or flat spacetime: the metric for a perfectly flat spacetime in weird coordinates can look quite complicated, while a curved spacetime can have a simple-looking metric. Our ultimate goal in this section is to define a <em>tensor</em> quantity (called the <strong>Riemann tensor</strong> that is zero in a flat spacetime and nonzero in a curved spacetime. We can therefore use this tensor quantity to distinguish between a curved and flat spactime no matter what coordinate system we are using to describe that spacetime.</p>
<p>An overview of the sections in this session follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Schwarzschild Geodesics.</strong> The Schwarzschild metric is a solution to the Einstein equation in the empty space surrounding a spherical star. This section will present the metric without proof and use the geodesic equation to derive equations of motion in such a spacetime. In addition to showing how we can use the geodesic equation to describe a realistic gravitational field, it also serves as a useful example of a truly curved spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Local Flatness Theorem.</strong> In the previous session, we derived the geodesic equation by requiring that a geodesic be straight in an imaginary locally flat patch of spacetime. In this section, we refine the concept of “local flatness,” to help us focus on what really distinguishes a globally flat spacetime from a locally flat spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Riemann Tensor.</strong> This section will explore the <strong>Riemann Tensor</strong>, a tensor quantity that is zero in flat spacetime but has 20 independent nonzero components in a curved spacetime. We will learn how to construct such a tensor and describe the built-in symmetries that constrain the number of independent components that it has.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="schwarzschild-geodesics.">Schwarzschild Geodesics.</h2>
<p>The <strong>Schwarzschild metric</strong> describes a possible coordinate system that one can use to describe the curved spacetime in the vacuum around a static, spherical, and non-rotating massive object: <span class="math display">\[ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-2GM/r} + r^2d\theta^2
+ r^2\sin^2\theta\:d\phi^2\]</span> (meaning that <span class="math inline">\(g_{tt} = -(1-2GM/r), g_{rr} = (1-2GM/r)^{-1},
g_{\theta\theta} = r^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_{\phi\phi} = r^2\sin^2\theta\)</span> and the off-diagonal metric components are zero). This is by no means the only possible metric even for the vacuum spacetime around a spherical star, since we can redefine coordinates in completely arbitrary ways and so generate an infinite number coordinate systems that describe the same physical reality. But this particular coordinate system has some advantages: it is independent of the time coordinate <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (in a diagonal metric, the time coordinate is the coordinate whose metric component is negative) and this metric reduces to the metric for flat spacetime (in a spherical coordinate-basis) as <span class="math inline">\(r\rightarrow\infty\)</span>. I should note that though I am using units where time and space are both measured in meters (so that <span class="math inline">\(c = 1\)</span>), I am <em>not</em> using units where the universal gravitational constant <span class="math inline">\(G = 1\)</span> as well, as is often done. I am doing this so that connections to Newtonian mechanics will be clearer. But it is good to keep in mind that in this unit system <span class="math inline">\(GM\)</span> has units of meters, and in fact <span class="math inline">\(GM =\)</span> 1477 m for a star with the mass of the sun (and is 4.45 mm for the Earth).</p>
<p>It is not my purpose here to show that this metric is a solution to the Einstein equation <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T^{\mu\nu}\)</span> in a vacuum: we are a long way from even defining the tensors that appear in that equation. At this point, let’s just accept that it is a valid solution in the specified situation. It is also not my purpose here to discuss the many fascinating features of this metric: the topic is somewhat tangential to the main line of my argument. But I want to introduce this metric so that we can explore the implications of the geodesic equation in a realistic situation (one that even applies to our daily lives!).</p>
<p>Consider a particle at least momentarily rest at some radial coordinate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. The spatial components of such a particle’s four-velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> are zero by definition (<span class="math inline">\(dr/d\tau = d\theta/d\tau = d\phi/d\tau = 0\)</span>), but in an arbitrary coordinate system we cannot conclude that the four-velocity’s time component <span class="math inline">\(u^t = dt/d\tau\)</span>, as we could in special relativity. Rather, we must go back to the basic result for the magnitude of the four-velocity, which (by definition of the differential proper time) still says: <span class="math display">\[u \cdot u \equiv u^\mu g_{\mu\nu}u^\nu = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau} = \frac{g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu}{d\tau^2} = \frac{ds^2}{d\tau^2} = \frac{-d\tau^2}{d\tau^2} = -1\]</span></p>
<p>For a particle at rest, this equation reduces to <span class="math display">\[-1 = u^\mu g_{\mu\nu}u^\nu = g_{tt}(u^t)^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
u^t = \frac{dt}{d\tau} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{-g_{tt}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2GM/r}}\]</span> This equation says that a clock attached to a particle at rest registers a proper time between events along its worldline that is smaller than the Schwarzschild coordinate time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> between those events. This one consequence of the curvature of spacetime in the Schwarzschild geometry. We see that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, though it is a “time coordinate,” is not the time that just any clock at any finite <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> would read, but rather a kind of global bookkeeper’s time stamp. It only coincides with the time that a clock would directly read if the clock is at rest at infinity.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-component of the geodesic equation in this situation says that the particle’s radial coordinate proper acceleration is given by <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2r}{d\tau^2} = -\Gamma^r_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}
= -\Gamma^r_{tt}u^tu^t + \text{zeros}\]</span> So to evaluate this radial acceleration, we only need to evaluate <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
\Gamma^{\,r}_{tt} &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}g^{r\alpha}(\partial_t g_{t\alpha}
+\partial_t g_{\alpha t}-\partial_\alpha g_{tt})
= \tfrac{1}{2}g^{rr}(0 + 0 - \partial_r g_{tt})\\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)
\frac{d}{dr}\left(-1+\frac{2GM}{r}\right)
= +\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)\frac{GM}{r^2}
\end{aligned}\]</span> Substituting this into the geodesic equation yields <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2r}{d\tau^2} = -\Gamma^r_{tt}u^tu^t
= -\frac{GM}{r^2}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)
\frac{1}{1-2GM/r} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}\]</span> This seems say us that the radial acceleration of a particle initially at rest (according to the particle’s own clock time) is exactly what we would expect from Newtonian mechanics. However, this is a <em>bit</em> misleading, because radial distance a particle moves between two events as it falls radially is not <em>quite</em> the same as the difference <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span> in the radial coordinate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. In fact, according to the metric, the spatial distance between two events that occur at the same time but at points with a purely radial coordinate separation of <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[ds = \sqrt{ds^2} = \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu} = \sqrt{g_{rr}dr^2 + \text{zeros}}
=\frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-2GM/r}}\label{ERAcc}\]</span> However, as long as <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 2GM\)</span>, this distinction is not important. For example, at the surface of the earth, where <span class="math inline">\(r =\)</span> 6380 km and <span class="math inline">\(2GM \approx\)</span> 0.9 cm, we’d have to keep track better than 8 decimal places in our measurements to notice that the Newtonian result for falling objects is not correct.</p>
<p>Still, there is an important lesson here that I am going to repeat over and over in the days to come. <strong><em>Coordinates by themselves have no physical meaning.</em></strong> Calling coordinates <span class="math inline">\(t, r, \theta, \phi\)</span> may cause you to <em>think</em> that you know what they mean, but we could have called these coordinates anything. <strong><em>The only thing that gives coordinates physical meaning is the metric</em></strong>, which is what anchors human coordinates to physical reality. One must always resort to the metric to learn what your coordinates actually mean.</p>
<p>This is a tricky idea, because we are so used to working with coordinates in flat spacetime (for example, spherical coordinates with an orthonormal basis) that have a reasonably direct intuitive meaning. But in general relativity, we have to give this up and use the metric <em>exclusively</em> to learn about what coordinates mean. But if you find this hard to grasp or remember, be comforted. Even Einstein struggled with this in the months leading up to his final November 1915 paper describing the Einstein equation.</p>
<h3 id="XFFI">Exercise: Free-Fall from Infinity.</h3>
<p>It turns out one solution to the full geodesic equation for a radially falling particle is <span class="math inline">\(dr/d\tau = -\sqrt{2GM/r}\)</span>. At what value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the particle at rest? At what value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(dr/d\tau = 1\)</span>? Does that necessarily mean that it is traveling at the speed of light?</p>
<h2 id="the-local-flatness-theorem">The Local Flatness Theorem</h2>
<p>The previous section described a physically useful example of coordinate system describing a genuinely curved spacetime. But our main goal here is to develop the tools for distinguishing between a curved and flat spacetime. A crucial step along that path is to the concept of “local flatness.” I have said before that a central assumption of the theory is that spacetime is never so curved that we can’t at least <em>locally</em> treat it as flat, just as we can with excellent accuracy use a flat map to describe, say, a city-sized region of the curved earth’s surface. But just how accurate can such a map be?</p>
<p>The <strong>local flatness theorem</strong> describes the general limits on just how well we can model a local patch of a curved spacetime by a flat spacetime. A statement of the theorem follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any given event <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> in spacetime, our freedom to choose coordinates allows us to construct a coordinate system where (1) <span class="math inline">\(g_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{P}) = \eta_{\mu\nu}\)</span> (with six degrees of freedom left over that correspond to arbitrary rotations and Lorentz boosts), (2) all 40 of the independent values of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\alpha g_{\mu\nu}\vert_\mathcal{P} = 0\)</span>, and (3) all but 20 of the 100 independent values of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\alpha\partial_\beta g_{\mu\nu}\vert_\mathcal{P}\)</span> equal to zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proof of this theorem is too involved to go into here: if you are interested, look at pp. 207-209 in my textbook. But the result is very important. It tells us that at every event in spacetime, we can (in principle) construct a reference frame that at least locally (if we don’t get too far from event <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>) behaves like laboratories we are used to.</p>
<p>We call a reference frame where <span class="math inline">\(g_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{P}) = \eta_{\mu\nu}\)</span> a <strong>locally orthonormal frame (LOF)</strong>, because <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}
\equiv \mathbf{e}_\mu\cdot[2pt]\mathbf{e}_\nu\)</span> means that the basis vectors for this coordinate system are orthogonal and have unit length, at least at event <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>. If our coordinate system only satisfies this first criterion but not the second (meaning that we don’t bother to set the first derivatives of the metric equal to zero), then at least some Christoffel symbols will not be zero, and geodesics will not be straight lines in our coordinate system. This would be analogous to a laboratory coordinate system at rest on the surface of the Earth. We can definitely set up such a coordinate system (we do it all the time), but geodesics (the worldlines of freely falling particles) are not straight lines in such a coordinate system.</p>
<p>We call a LOF that also satisfies the second criterion (all the first derivatives of the metric are zero) a <strong>locally inertial frame (LIF)</strong>. In this frame, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, and the worldlines of geodesics are (locally) straight lines. Near the earth’s surface, such a frame would be a freely-falling frame, such as the reference frame in a falling elevator or the International Space Station. In such a frame, we would need to look at geodesics over fairly large distances (or for fairly long times) to see the tidal effects that distinguish a freely-falling frame from a globally inertial frame in deep space. But no matter how good our coordinate system is, we will eventually see such effects, because we cannot set all of the <em>second</em> metric derivatives to zero (and thus first derivatives of the Christoffel symbols) to zero. This means that as we move far enough away from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> in space and/or time, we will eventually see the geodesics begin to converge or diverge as the Christoffel symbols begin to become appreciably nonzero.</p>
<h2 id="the-riemann-tensor.">The Riemann Tensor.</h2>
<p>The local flatness theorem makes it clear that the distinction between a curved spacetime and a flat spacetime is related to the fact that in a flat spacetime we can find a coordinate system (for example, a truly cartesian coordinate system where <em>all</em> 100 second derivatives of the metric are zero, whereas in a curved spacetime, the best we can do is set 80 of those second derivatives. But this would not seem to help us much, because even in a flat spacetime, a given set of coordinates may have nonzero second derivatives because it is not “the best” coordinate system we can choose.</p>
<p>One can also not tell whether a spacetime is curved or not simply by looking at the metric. Consider some metrics that we have seen before for two-dimensional spaces: <span class="math display">\[g_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + 4c^2p^2 &amp; 2cp \\
2cp &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix},
\quad \quad
g_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R^2 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; R^2\sin^2\theta
\end{bmatrix}\]</span> There is no obvious clue in these metrics that the first is flat space in disguise, while the second describes an intrinsically curved space.</p>
<p>The most logical approach would be to go back to the most fundamental characteristic of a curved spacetime: the relative acceleration of neighboring geodesics. One can in fact use this approach (and I do in my textbook), but the mathematics is quite involved and not particularly transparent. Time is short here, so I am going to present a different approach that takes advantage of the Local Flatness theorem. Consider the tensor quantity (where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is an arbitrary four-vector): <span class="math display">\[\label{ECommTG}
(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - \nabla_\nu\nabla_\mu) A^\alpha
= \nabla_\mu(\nabla_\nu A^\alpha) - \nabla_\nu(\nabla_\mu A^\alpha)\]</span> This quantity expresses the commutativity of the tensor gradient. Suppose that we evaluate this quantity in a truly flat spacetime. In such a spacetime, we can find a truly Euclidean coordinate system where not only the metric reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\mu\nu}\)</span> but <em>all derivatives of the metric</em> are also zero. In such a case, the quantity above reduces to <span class="math inline">\((\partial_\mu\partial_\nu - \partial_\nu\partial_\mu)A^\alpha = 0\)</span>, because the order of partial derivatives does not matter. But in a curved spacetime, the Local Flatness Theorem states that we can never set all of the metric’s <em>second derivatives</em> to zero (the best we can do is set all but 20 equal to zero at the system’s origin). But as we expand the expressions for the tensor gradients in the expression above, we will find that we are evaluating derivatives of Christoffel symbols, and such derivatives will involve second derivatives of the metric, which will <em>not</em> generally be zero in a curved spacetime. So this might be the tensor quantity we seek.</p>
<p>Let’s evaluate this quantity in terms of Christoffel symbols to get more insight. Treating each of the terms in equation <a href="#ECommTG" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ECommTG">[ECommTG]</a> separately and using the rules for the tensor gradient, we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
\nabla_\mu(\nabla_\nu A^\alpha) &amp;= \partial_\mu(\nabla_\nu A^\alpha)
-\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}(\nabla_\beta A^\alpha)
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}(\nabla_\nu A^\sigma) \\
&amp;= \partial_\mu(\partial_\nu A^\alpha
+ \Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\gamma}A^\gamma)
-\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}(\partial_\beta A^\alpha
+ \Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\delta}A^\delta)
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}(\partial_\nu A^\sigma
+ \Gamma^\sigma_{\nu\rho}A^\rho) \\
&amp;= \partial_\mu\partial_\nu A^\alpha
+ (\partial_\mu\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\gamma})A^\gamma
+ \Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\gamma}\partial_\mu A^\gamma
-\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}\partial_\beta A^\alpha
-\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\delta}A^\delta
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}\partial_\nu A^\sigma
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\nu\rho}A^\rho
\end{aligned}\]</span> The second term is the same except with <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> swapped. So subtracting it from the term above yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
&amp;+ \xcancel{\partial_\mu\partial_\nu A^\alpha}
+ (\partial_\mu\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\gamma})A^\gamma
+ \bcancel{\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\gamma}\partial_\mu A^\gamma}
-\xcancel{\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}\partial_\beta A^\alpha}
-\xcancel{\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\delta}A^\delta}
+\cancel{\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}\partial_\nu A^\sigma}
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\nu\rho}A^\rho \\
&amp;-\xcancel{\partial_\nu\partial_\mu A^\alpha}

+\xcancel{\Gamma^\beta_{\nu\mu}\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\delta}A^\delta}

&amp;= (\partial_\mu\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\beta}
-\partial_\nu\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta}
+\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\nu\beta}
-\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\mu\beta})A^\beta
\end{aligned}\]</span> where I have taken advantage of the commutativity of the partial derivative, the symmetry of the lower two indices of the Christoffel symbols, and the irrelevance of bound index names to make the cancellations indicated. In the last step, I have renamed the bound <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> index in the first two terms and the bound <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> index in the last two terms to <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Since this difference is a tensor and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is a tensor, the quantity in parentheses must be a tensor. We call this tensor the <strong>Riemann tensor:</strong> <span class="math display">\[R^{\alpha}_{\beta \mu \nu} \equiv \partial_{\mu}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\nu \beta} -\partial_{\nu}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\mu \beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\mu \sigma}\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu \beta} - \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\nu \sigma}\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu \beta}\]</span> Here is a mnemonic for this expression. Note that the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> indices are the first two free lower indices in all the terms, and they appear in that order in the positive terms, but reversed in the negative terms. The products of the Christoffel symbols involve a sum over the last index of the first symbol and the upper index of the next. So remember: “3 to 4 is positive and twins bond inside,” meaning that the 3rd and 4th indices of the Riemann tensor appear in that order in the positive terms (and in the opposite order in negative terms), and the bound indices in the terms involving two Christoffel symbols are the indices closest together.</p>
<p>Note that the order of the indices is very important in the Riemann tensor, one of the first tensors we have seen where this is really so. Indeed the Riemann tensor has important symmetry properties that describe what happens when we change the index order.</p>
<p>We can see directly from its definition that the Riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its last two indices: <span class="math display">\[R^{\alpha}{\ \beta\mu\nu} = -R^{\alpha}{\ \beta\nu\mu}\]</span> However, the tensor has some other symmetries that are easiest to see if we lower the first index: <span class="math display">\[R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} = g_{\alpha\gamma}R^{\gamma}_{\beta\mu\nu}\]</span> Then, we can write the other symmetries as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} = -R_{\beta\alpha\mu\nu} \quad \quad
&amp;\text{(antisymmetry in the first two indices)}\\
&amp;R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} = +R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} \quad \quad
&amp;\text{(symmetry in the the index pairs)}\\
&amp;R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} + R_{\alpha\nu\beta\mu} + R_{\alpha\mu\nu\beta}
= 0 \quad &amp;\text{(cyclic rotation of the final three indices)}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The easiest way to <em>prove</em> these identities is to evaluate these tensor equations at the origin of a LIF. At that event in a LIF, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, but the derivatives of those symbols (which involve second derivatives of the metric) are not necessarily zero. So at the origin of a LIF, we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} &amp;= g_{\alpha\gamma}R^\gamma_{\beta\mu\nu}
= g_{\alpha\gamma}(\partial_\mu\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\beta}
-\partial_\nu\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta})\\
&amp;= g_{\alpha\gamma}\partial_\mu[\:\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\gamma\sigma}
(\partial_\nu g_{\beta\sigma} + \partial_\beta g_{\sigma\nu}
- \partial_\sigma g_{\nu\beta})\:] - g_{\alpha\gamma}
\partial_\nu[\:\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\gamma\sigma}
(\partial_\mu g_{\beta\sigma} + \partial_\beta g_{\sigma\mu}
- \partial_\sigma g_{\mu\beta})\:]
\end{aligned}\]</span> Now, at the origin in a LIF, only the second derivatives of the metric are possibly nonzero, so we can pull the <span class="math inline">\(g^{\gamma\sigma}\)</span> out in front of the derivatives to get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}g_{\alpha\gamma}g^{\gamma\sigma}(
\xcancel{\partial_\mu\partial_\nu g_{\beta\sigma}}
+ \partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\sigma\nu}
- \partial_\mu\partial_\sigma g_{\nu\beta}
-\xcancel{\partial_\nu\partial_\mu g_{\beta\sigma}}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\sigma\mu}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\sigma g_{\mu\beta})\\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}\delta^\sigma_\alpha(
\partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\sigma\nu}
- \partial_\mu\partial_\sigma g_{\nu\beta}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\sigma\mu}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\sigma g_{\mu\beta})\\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(
\partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\alpha\nu}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha g_{\mu\beta}
- \partial_\mu\partial_\alpha g_{\nu\beta}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\alpha\mu})
\quad \quad \text{(only at a LIF origin!)}
\end{aligned}\]</span> The mnemonic here is “inner togetherness is positive:” when the inner indices <span class="math inline">\(\beta\mu\)</span> appear together in either the partial derivatives or the metric, the term is positive (the two negative terms split these indices up). We can see that the Riemann tensor does indeed involve second derivatives of the metric!</p>
<p>All of the symmetries are easy to prove using this form of the Riemann tensor. For example, using the “inner togetherness” mnemonic, we see that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}[b]
R_{\beta\alpha\mu\nu} &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(
\partial_\mu\partial_\alpha g_{\beta\nu}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha}
- \partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\nu\alpha}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu})\\
&amp;= -\tfrac{1}{2}(
\partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\nu\alpha}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu}
-\partial_\mu\partial_\alpha g_{\beta\nu}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha})\\
&amp;= -\tfrac{1}{2}(
\partial_\mu\partial_\beta g_{\alpha\nu}
+\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha g_{\mu\beta}
-\partial_\mu\partial_\alpha g_{\nu\beta}
-\partial_\nu\partial_\beta g_{\alpha\mu})
\equiv -R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}
\end{aligned}\]</span> since the metric is symmetric. The other proofs are similarly straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, one of the reasons these symmetries are relevant is that we can use them to count independent components of the Riemann tensor. The tensor formally has <span class="math inline">\(4\times 4\times 4\times 4 = 256\)</span> components, but many of these components are zero and even more are not independent. Let’s represent the index names abstractly by 0, 1, 2, and 3 (rather than something like <span class="math inline">\(t, x, y, z\)</span> that would refer to a specific coordinate system) First we note that any component whose final indices or initial indices are the same is automatically zero: for example, <span class="math inline">\(R_{0023} = -R_{0023}\)</span> after switching the first two indices, but only zero can equal negative itself. So only name for the index pairs <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\nu\)</span> that might yield independent tensor components are the six pairs 01, 02, 03, 12, 13, and 23: all other pairs yield either components that are zero or are related by index reversal. Let’s arrange these possibly independent values in a chart:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rccccccc}

<p>Now, of the 36 components on this chart, the 15 above underlined diagonal elements are the same as the 15 below, because <span class="math inline">\(R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} = +R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\)</span>. Therefore, only 6 + 15 = 21 components on this chart are independent.</p>
<p>Finally, the symmetry equation <span class="math inline">\(R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} + R_{\alpha\nu\beta\mu} + R_{\alpha\mu\nu\beta} = 0\)</span> looks like it puts 256 conditions on components of the metric, but actually, on the basis of what we know already, this equation is identically zero if <em>any</em> two indices have the same name. For example, say that the second and fourth indices have the same name 1: then the equation claims that <span class="math inline">\(R_{\alpha 1 \mu 1} + R_{\alpha 1 1 \mu} + R_{\alpha \mu 1 1} = 0\)</span>. But the first two terms cancel because of the antisymmetry of the last two indices, and the last term is also zero because because of the same issue. Therefore this equation simply states that 0 = 0, which does say anything useful. The only component of this equation that says something new is therefore <span class="math inline">\(R_{0123} + R_{0312} + R_{0213} = 0\)</span>. This puts one additional constraint on the Riemann tensor components, leaving 20 that are independent.</p>
<p>These 20 components are linearly independent combinations of the 20 metric double-derivatives that we cannot force to zero by choosing coordinates in a curved spacetime. The fact that these counts are equal means that none of these metric derivatives is omitted or canceled out when we construct the Riemann tensor. This means that <em>any</em> deviation from flat spacetime should be registered by the Riemann tensor.</p>

<p>In a two-dimensional space, only one Riemann tensor component is possibly independent: <span class="math inline">\(R_{0101}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Explain how and why all other components depend on this one (or are zero).</p></li>
<li><p>We have seen that for the <span class="math inline">\(p,q\)</span> parabolic coordinate system we have discussed in previous exercises, only one Christoffel symbol was nonzero <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma^q_{pp} = 2c\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant. Show that <span class="math inline">\(R_{pqpq} = 0\)</span> in this case, proving purely from the metric that parabolic coordinates must describe a flat space. For fast reference, the metric for parabolic coordinates is <span class="math display">\[g_{\mu\nu} =
