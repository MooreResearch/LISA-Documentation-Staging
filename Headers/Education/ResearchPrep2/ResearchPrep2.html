<h2 id="SGR">Overview of General Relativity</h2>
<p>Perhaps the defining characteristic of Einstein’s thought was his ability to discern simple principles behind complex phenomena. His entire theory of special relativity follows from two simple and credible principles: (1) the <strong>principle of relativity</strong> (which states that the laws of physics are independent of inertial reference frame), and (2) his assertion that Maxwell’s equations are such laws (which in turn implies that <strong>the speed of light is frame-independent</strong>).</p>
<p>His theory of general relativity has a reputation for being complicated and abstruse, but it similarly rests on two simple principles: (1) the <strong>geodesic hypothesis</strong>, which states that free particles follow geodesics in spacetime) and (2) the <strong>principle of coordinate independence</strong>, which states that the laws of physics are independent of <em>any</em> choice of coordinates. The latter might seem to be an obvious generalization of the principle of relativity, but people (even Einstein himself) have found it hard to fully appreciate that spacetime coordinates have <em>no intrinsic physical meaning</em>, so underlining this principle is valuable. I will have much more to say about it as we go along.</p>
<p>Now, conceptual treatments of general relativity often follow Einstein’s own mental trajectory by starting with the <strong>equivalence principle</strong>, which such treatments usually describe as stating that a reference frame at rest on a gravitating object is equivalent to an accelerating laboratory in deep space. I have found such approaches to be difficult both philosophically and pedagogically. The geodesic hypothesis, on the other hand, is less ambiguous and more directly focuses one on the essence of general relativity. One can more properly consider the equivalence principle to be a <em>consequence</em> of the geodesic hypothesis, as we will see.</p>
<p>The geodesic hypothesis is based on an empirical observation that goes back at least as far as Galileo: in a gravitational field, <em>all objects fall with the same acceleration</em>. In particular, this means that <em>every</em> particle launched from a given position with a given initial velocity in a given gravitational field will follow the <em>same</em> trajectory,irrespective of that particle’s characteristics. Since Galileo, this statement has been empirically checked with increasing accuracy to the point that we now know that the gravitational accelerations of very different objects differ by less than one part in about <span class="math inline">\(10^{13}\)</span>. This behavior is quite different than that of objects in other fields: for example, in an given electric field, electrons, muons, positrons, and neutrinos follow quite different trajectories, even if launched from the same point with the same initial velocity.</p>
<p>We can explain the unique behavior of particles in a gravitational field if we assume that a free particle’s trajectory is <em>not</em> determined by that particle’s interaction with the field but rather <em>only</em> by the spacetime through which the particle moves. But how can spacetime itself uniquely specify a trajectory? We know that the shape of a simple two-dimensional surface uniquely defines curves on that surface that we call <em>geodesics</em>, which we can define as either being the curve between two points that has an extremal pathlength or that is “as straight as possible.” The geodesic hypothesis simply extends this idea to the case at hand: a “free” particle (one does not interact with anything else) hypothetically follows a geodesic in spacetime.</p>
<p>Note that the geodesic hypothesis only works in spacetime, not in ordinary three-dimensional space. For example, suppose that we toss a ball with an initial horizontal velocity component of 5 m/s between two points <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> separated by 10 meters in space. We can also fire a bullet with an initial horizontal velocity component of 500 m/s in such a way that it travels between the same two points. Both objects hypothetically follow geodesics, but if we only pay attention their trajectories <em>in space</em>, we would conclude that we have at least two possible geodesics between the spatial points <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, meaning that the “geodesic between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>” is poorly defined (see figure <a href="#BallBullet" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="BallBullet">1</a>a). If we plot the trajectories on a spacetime diagram, though (see figure <a href="#BallBullet" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="BallBullet">1</a>b), then we see that these objects do not travel between the same points (events) in spacetime at all, because their velocities are very different. Objects that pass through the same position in space <em>with the same velocity</em> would follow identical trajectories in spacetime, meaning that the geodesic is indeed unique <em>in spacetime</em>. But an interesting thing is that even the <em>different</em> geodesics of the bullet and ball have the <em>same</em> radius of curvature (measured by matching their respective parabolas as closely as possible to circles) of about 1 ly! This suggests that geodesics near the earth’s surface are indeed curved in a similar way.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="Fig1-1.pdf" id="BallBullet" /><figcaption>(a) The trajectory of a free object traveling between two points in space is not unique. (b) But when viewed in spacetime, the bullet and ball do not move between the same two “points” (events), and thus follow different geodesics. However, both geodesics have the same curvature.

</figure>
<p>Note also that since all objects fall in a gravitational field with the same acceleration, if we view a set of objects in a freely falling reference frame (for example, inside the International Space Station), their relative accelerations will be very nearly zero, meaning that in such a frame we will see free objects moving with constant velocities, consistent with Newton’s first law. Now, we <em>define</em> an inertial frame to be reference frame in which a “free object” obeys Newton’s first law. In Newtonian mechanics, however, we typically assume that a frame at rest on the Earth’s surface is inertial, and explain away the accelerated paths of falling objects by saying that they are not really free, but rather subject to a “force of gravity.” But we see that the geodesic hypothesis implies that even near the surface of the Earth we can always find a reference frame (a freely falling frame) where <em>all</em> objects free from non-gravitational interactions obey Newton’s first law, and so we can always make “the force of gravity” disappear by changing our reference frame. Any other force that we can make appear or disappear by changing frames we would call a fictitious force. So to be consistent, we really should take the definition of an inertial frame <em>literally</em> and say that near the surface of the Earth, the truly inertial frames are not those frames which are at rest (or moving at a constant velocity) with respect to the Earth’s surface, but rather frames that are freely falling. A frame that is at rest on the surface of the earth is accelerating upward relative to any inertial frames in the vicinity, and so is analogous to a frame in deep space that is accelerating upward with respect to a neighboring freely floating frame (hence the “equivalence principle” and all its consequences).</p>
<p>In particular, this implies the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. If one seeks to measure an object’s gravitational mass by putting it on a scale in either a frame at rest on the earth’s surface or a frame accelerating in deep space, the upward force the scale exerts on the object is simply the force required to accelerate the object relative to its geodesic (which at each instant is accelerating downward relative to the object) in each case. Therefore, what we call an object’s “weight” must <em>by definition</em> be proportional to its inertial mass, which is what determines how much force one needs to deliver a certain acceleration.</p>
<p>So, we can make “the force of gravity” completely disappear in a freely falling frame. Does that make gravity entirely fictitious? No! The “gravitational force” is fictitious, but there is an aspect of gravity that we can observe even in a freely falling frame. To see this, consider a large room that is freely falling near the earth’s surface. Suppose we place four balls so that they float initially at rest above and below and to the right and left of the room’s center of mass. Let’s compare what happens to such balls to the behavior of balls similarly deployed in a frame floating in deep space (see figure <a href="#BigRoom" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="BigRoom">2</a>).</p>
<p>To see what happens, let’s retreat into the Newtonian mind-set (which will predict the right behavior even if it interprets that behavior differently). According to Newtonian mechanics, the room’s center of mass falls toward the earth with a certain acceleration. The ball above the center of mass is a bit further from the earth’s center, so it falls with a bit smaller acceleration, and ball below the center of mass falls with a bit greater acceleration. The balls to the right and left accelerate toward the earth’s center along lines that make a small inward angle with respect to the trajectory of the room’s center of mass. So as time passes, we see the top and bottom balls slowly accelerating <em>away</em> from the room’s center and the side balls accelerating <em>toward</em> that center, <em>unlike</em> the balls in the frame floating in deep space (which remain strictly at rest).</p>
<figure>
<embed src="Fig1-2.pdf" id="BigRoom" /><figcaption>(a) Because the gravitational field of any gravitating object is non-uniform, off-center floating balls in a freely falling frame will accelerate slightly relative to the room’s center of mass. (b) Such accelerations are not seen in an inertial frame floating far from a gravitating object. From Moore, <em>A General Relativity Workbook,</em> University Science Books, 2013, p. 7.</figcaption>

<figure>
<embed src="Fig1-3.pdf" id="CurvedWLs" /><figcaption>Plotted on a spacetime diagram, the side balls’ initially parallel trajectories curve toward each other as time passes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since we can observe these <strong>tidal effects</strong> of gravity even in an inertial (freely falling frame) near a gravitating object but not in an analogous inertial frame in deep space, they are a frame-independent and thus non-fictitious indication that we are near a gravitating object.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#CurvedWLs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="CurvedWLs">3</a> shows a spacetime diagram of the trajectories of the side balls in our falling-room thought experiment. Since these balls are initially at rest in our reference frame, their paths in spacetime are initially parallel. But as time passes, their relative accelerations curve the paths toward each other.</p>
<p>But these paths are <em>geodesics</em>, which are by definition the straightest possible lines we have in spacetime. A basic axiom of Euclidean (plane) geometry is that initially parallel lines (geodesics) remain parallel. Since initially parallel geodesics in the spacetime near a gravitating object do <em>not</em> remain parallel, that spacetime must be <em>curved</em> (non-Euclidean). <em>Gravity curves spacetime.</em></p>
<p>The core task of general relativity is therefore to predict <em>how</em> a gravitating object affects the curvature of spacetime (as indicated by the relative acceleration of neighboring geodesics). The Einstein Equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G^{\mu\nu} = 8\pi GT^{\mu\nu}\]</span> does precisely this. <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu\nu}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(4\times4\)</span> matrix that expresses something about the curvature of spacetime at a given point (event) in spacetime, <span class="math inline">\(T^{\mu\nu}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(4\times4\)</span> matrix that describes the density and flow of energy at that same point, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the Newtonian universal gravitational constant. This and the <strong>geodesic equation</strong> <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2x^\alpha}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu = 0\]</span> (which explains how to calculate the geodesics along which free particles move, and whose terms I will explain tomorrow) comprise the core equations of general relativity, playing roles analogous to the roles that Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law play, respectively, in the theory of electrodynamics. The great theorist John Archibald Wheeler summarized the essence of these two equations (in reverse order) this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What could be simpler?</p>
<p>That’s it! You now know the essence of general relativity. What remains is to work out the mathematical meaning of these equations and their implications.</p>
<h2 id="SGA">The Geometric Analogy and the Metric Equation</h2>
<p>The first step in this process is to review some special relativity. A typical undergraduate treatment of special relativity starts by postulating the principle of relativity and the frame-independence of the speed of light, works from there to the phenomena of time dilation and length contraction (often carelessly expressed as “moving clocks run slow” and “moving objects are contracted”), and then uses those ideas to derive the Lorentz transformation and the Einstein velocity transformation.</p>
<p>However, this approach has serious pedagogical flaws, particularly for students journeying toward general relativity. The core problem is that is that people too easily think that motion somehow physically causes clocks to slow down and objects to become compressed, and that misunderstanding leads people to paradoxes and errors. For example, one can easily devise situations where the time measured between a given pair of events is actually <em>longer</em> in a moving reference frame than in a frame at rest.</p>
<p>Over the years I have found it more fruitful to begin with what I call the <strong>geometric analogy</strong>. Consider two points on a two dimensional plane (see Figure <a href="#GA" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="GA">4</a>a). One can characterize the spatial separation of these points in three fundamentally different ways: (1) by projecting their separation on the axes of some Cartesian coordinate system, thereby determining their coordinate separations <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>, (2) by using a tape measure to determine the pathlength <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \ell\)</span> along a certain path between the points, and (3) by measuring the pathlength between them along a <em>straight</em> path between them, which yields the <em>distance</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta d\)</span> between the points. In this situation, no one is surprised that the coordinate separations measured in differently oriented coordinate systems are different. Nor is anyone surprised that the pathlength along a curved path between the points is different than the pathlength along a straight path (a geodesic). The results are different because <em>we are measuring these separations in physically distinct ways</em>.</p>
<p>The analogy to spacetime is direct. The two-dimensional plane corresponds to spacetime (which, to make the analogy clearer, we will compress to two dimensions, one of space and one of time). Points on the plane correspond to <strong>events</strong> in spacetime (physical incidents, such as the collision of two particles or the emission of a flash, that mark a well-defined position in space and instant of time). Differently oriented Cartesian coordinate systems on the plane correspond to inertial reference frames moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Different paths between points correspond to different trajectories (called <strong>worldlines</strong>) between events. Just as we can characterize the separation of points by their coordinate separations <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>, the pathlength <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \ell\)</span> along a given path between them, or the distance <span class="math inline">\(\Delta d\)</span> between them, we can characterize the separation of events in spacetime by (1) their <strong>spacetime coordinate separations</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> in a given inertial reference frame, (2) the <strong>proper time</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau_w\)</span> measured by a clock traveling along a certain worldline (trajectory) between them, or (3) the <strong>spacetime interval</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau\)</span> measured by a clock traveling along a geodesic (inertial) worldline between them. We should no more be surprised the time-separations <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t, \Delta \tau_w,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau\)</span> are different than we would be that the separations <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y, 
\Delta \ell,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta d\)</span> are different in space. The three kinds of time (coordinate time, proper time, and spacetime interval), though all measured with clocks, are different not because motion somehow affects the clocks but because we are measuring these times <em>in entirely different ways</em>. Laying a tape measure along a curved path does not magically shrink the distance between its marks so that it yields a larger result than a tape measure laid along a straight path: the pathlength along the curved path is simply physically longer. Similarly, a clock following a curved worldline between two events is not magically slowed down by its motion: it simply accurately registers that the time measured along that worldline is physically different than the time measured along a geodesic worldline.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="Fig1-4.pdf" id="GA" /><figcaption>The geometric analogy: <em>points</em> in a 2D planar space are analogous to <em>events</em> in spacetime; <em>curves</em> correspond to trajectories (<em>worldlines</em>), Cartesian <em>coordinate systems</em> correspond to <em>inertial frames</em>; <em>pathlength</em> corresponds to <em>proper time</em>, and <em>distance</em> corresponds to <em>spacetime interval</em>. (For why the spacetime axes of the primed reference frame are not perpendicular and how we project coordinate separations on those axes, see Moore, <em>Six Ideas That Shaped Physics,</em> 3e, McGraw-Hill, 2017, Unit R, pp. 88-94.)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Part of the importance of this analogy is that it focuses our attention on what is relative and what is absolute. Measuring either the pathlength or the distance between points on a plane involves only laying out a tape measure and reading what it says, not projecting anything on a coordinate axis. Therefore, all observers will agree on what the tape measure says: pathlength and distance are <em>coordinate-independent quantities</em>. Similarly, measuring proper time and the spacetime interval between two events both involve sending a clock from one event to another along some trajectory and reading what that clock says is the time elapsed. Since every observer in every reference frame can read what the clock says, proper time and spacetime interval are <em>frame-independent</em> (absolute) <em>quantities</em> by definition.</p>
<p>On the other hand, setting up a coordinate system on a plane involves a procedure for determining what points have the same projection on (say) the vertical axis so that we assign them all the same vertical coordinate as whichever such point actually lies on that axis. Obviously, reorienting the vertical axis changes the set of points that we consider to have the same vertical coordinate, so the coordinates of points depend on one’s choice of reference frame. Analogously, in a given inertial reference frame, we have a procedure (based on the frame-independence of the speed of light) that allows us to synchronize clocks in a given frame and thus determine which events we consider to occur at the same time. Going to a different reference frame changes the set of events we consider to be simultaneous, implying that spacetime coordinates are frame-<em>dependent</em> (relative).</p>
<p>Indeed, I think that special relativity is entirely misnamed. The historically shocking element of the theory was that it established that time was not absolute, but rather behaved more like the <em>y</em>-coordinate of a rotatable coordinate axis, and the “relativity” of time is what a lot of popular treatments focus on. But the theory’s real value is that it tells us what is <em>absolute</em> about the physical reality that lies behind the arbitrary coordinate systems that we place upon it, and this anchor to reality becomes even more crucial in general relativity. So perhaps we ought to call the theories special and general absolutivity!</p>
<p>The key to mathematically connecting coordinate systems to the coordinate-independent separation between points is the pythagorean theorem, which tells us that no matter what coordinate system we use, we can <em>calculate</em> the coordinate-independent distance <span class="math inline">\(\Delta d\)</span> between the points from the coordinate-dependent coordinate differences as follows: <span class="math display">\[\Delta d^2 = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 = (\Delta x^\prime)^2 + (\Delta y^\prime)^2\]</span> We call the corresponding equation in spacetime that allows us to connect frame-dependent coordinate differences to the frame-independent spacetime interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau\)</span> between two events the <strong>metric equation</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\Delta \tau^2 = \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2
= (\Delta t^\prime)^2 - (\Delta x^\prime)^2 - (\Delta y^\prime)^2 - (\Delta z^\prime)^2\]</span> as long as we work in units where <span class="math inline">\(c = 1\)</span>, meaning that we express time intervals in meters (where 1 m of time <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> the time it takes light to travel 1 m of distance). We will use such units exclusively in what follows.</p>
<p>The minus signs that appear in the metric equation (which follow from the requirement that the speed of light be the same in all frames) underlines the fact that our geometric analogy is not perfect, and reflects the reality that we experience time very differently than we experience space. (They are also responsible for the fact that the <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\)</span> coordinate axis tilts upward rather than downward in Figure <a href="#GA" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="GA">4</a>b and other subtle issues with the analogy that I won’t discuss here.)</p>
<p>Note that we can also use the metric equation to calculate proper times along an arbitrary worldline in the same way that we use the pythagorean theorem to calculate pathlengths along arbitrary curves on a plane. We divide the worldline into segments so short that each segment is essentially straight. The proper time measured by a clock traveling along this segment of the should then be very nearly same as the spacetime interval between its endpoints, and the approximation becomes exact as the segment becomes infinitesimal: <span class="math inline">\((d\tau_w)^2 \approx d\tau^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2\)</span>. To get the total proper time, we simply add up the infinitesimal spacetime intervals along each segment: <span class="math display">\[\Delta \tau_w = \int \sqrt{dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2}
= \int \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2
-\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2}\ dt = \int \sqrt{1-v^2}\ dt\]</span> So if we know a clock’s speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as a function of coordinate time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> <em>as evaluated an arbitrary but specific inertial reference frame</em> as the clock moves along a given worldline, we can calculate the time that the clock will read at every event along that worldline.</p>
<p>Now, the spacetime interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> is physically meaningful only between events that can be connected by a clock moving at less than the speed of light. It is certainly possible to find a pair of events (say a pair of events that occur simultaneously in some inertial reference frame) where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2 &lt; 0\)</span>, meaning that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau\)</span> would be imaginary. But (as we will see shortly) the value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2\)</span> has a frame-independent value no matter what its sign might be. If its value is frame-independent, then so is its sign, so we can classify pairs of events into frame-independent categories as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
\text{\textbf{Timelike:}} &amp; \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2 &gt; 0 \\
\text{\textbf{Spacelike:}} &amp; \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2 &lt; 0 \\
\text{\textbf{Lightlike:}} &amp; \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2 = 0
\end{matrix}\]</span> When events have a timelike separation, we have seen that we can measure the spacetime interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> between them using a clock that travels between them. If events have a spacelike separation, we can measure their <strong>spacetime separation</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s^2 \equiv
- \Delta t^2 + \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2\)</span> by using a ruler to measure the distance between them in an inertial frame where they occur at the same time. Since all observers will agree whether or not a frame satisfies those criteria, and can look over each others’ shoulders to see what the ruler in that frame measures, this is still a frame-independent number (as claimed). Events having a lightlike separation can be connected by a traveling photon, and all observers can agree on whether that is possible too.</p>
<p>Most (but not all) general relativity authors express the metric equation in terms of the spacetime separation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s\)</span>, not the spacetime interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> (though the term “spacetime interval” is often loosely applied to both <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>). Therefore, we usually write the metric equation as <span class="math display">\[\Delta s^2 = -\Delta t^2 + \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2 \quad
( = -\Delta\tau^2)\]</span> and the event separation categories are <span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
\text{\textbf{Timelike:}} &amp; \Delta s^2 &lt; 0 \\
\text{\textbf{Spacelike:}} &amp; \Delta s^2 &gt; 0 \\
\text{\textbf{Lightlike:}} &amp; \Delta s^2 = 0
\end{matrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Let me emphasize again the importance of the metric equation. It is the key to connecting our arbitrary human-defined coordinates to the physical reality that lies behind them. As our coordinate systems become even more arbitrary in general relativity, the metric equation plays an even more central role. The interval classifications also remain crucial, because they tell us whether a given pair of events can be connected by an object traveling at less than the speed of light or not.</p>

<p>Consider now two inertial reference frames in <strong>standard orientation</strong> (each spatial axis of the primed frame points in the same spatial direction as the corresponding axis in the unprimed frame, and the primed frame moves along the common <span class="math inline">\(+x\)</span> direction relative to the unprimed frame with a velocity <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-component of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>). The Lorentz transformation equations state that, given an event, we can calculate its spacetime coordinates in the primed frame from its coordinates in the unprimed frame or vice-versa as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
t^\prime &amp;= \gamma t - \gamma \beta x \\
x^\prime &amp;= -\gamma \beta t + \gamma x \\
y^\prime &amp;= y \\
z^\prime &amp;= z
\end{aligned}
\quad \quad \quad
\begin{aligned}
t &amp;= \gamma t^\prime + \gamma \beta x^\prime \\
x &amp;= \gamma \beta t^\prime + \gamma x^\prime \\
y &amp;= y^\prime\\
z &amp;= z^\prime
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \equiv 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}\)</span>. (Note that the fact that the inverse transformation simply involves flipping the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> expresses the fundamental equivalence of the two frames: the <em>only</em> distinction between them is that we have arbitrarily defined <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to be the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-velocity of the primed frame relative to the unprimed frame rather than the reverse.) Define 16-component objects labeled with two indices as follows <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} =
\begin{array}{c}
\\
t\\
x\\
y\\
z\\
\end{array}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &amp; - \gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
-\gamma\beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \quad \quad
(\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu} =
\begin{array}{c}
\\
t\\
x\\
y\\
z\\
\end{array}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &amp;  \gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\gamma\beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where each greek index ranges over the four possible values <span class="math inline">\(t, x, y, z\)</span>. (The reason that one index is super-scripted as opposed to sub-scripted will be clearer shortly.) Similarly, we can abstractly write one of the coordinates in the form <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x^t \equiv t, x^x \equiv x, x^y \equiv y, z^z \equiv z\)</span>. (Again, these are super-scripted indices, not exponents.) We can therefore write the Lorentz transformation equations in compact form as follows: <span class="math display">\[x&#39;^{\mu} = \sum_{\nu \in \{t, x, y, z\}}\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu}\;x^{\nu}
\quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad
x^{\mu} = \sum_{\nu \in \{t, x, y, z\}}(\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu}\;x&#39;^{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>We can write this even more compactly if we adopt the <strong>Einstein summation convention</strong>, which states that when the same index appears in both an upper and lower position, we should <em>assume</em> that we are summing over that index. Adopting this convention means that we can write the Lorentz transformation and its inverse using this <strong>index notation</strong> in the very compact form <span class="math display">\[x&#39;^{\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} x^{\nu}
\quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad
x^{\mu} = (\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu} x&#39;^{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the Lorentz transformation is linear, the same equations apply to the coordinate <em>differences</em> between an arbitrary pair of events: <span class="math display">\[\Delta x&#39;^{\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} \Delta x^{\nu}
\quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad
\Delta x^{\mu} = (\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu} \Delta x&#39;^{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>These equations are equivalent to the matrix equations <span class="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta t^\prime \\ \Delta x^\prime \\ \Delta y^\prime \\ \Delta z^\prime
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma &amp; - \gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0\phantom{/} \\
-\gamma\beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \phantom{/}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta t \\ \Delta x \\ \Delta y \\ \Delta z
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta t \\ \Delta x \\ \Delta y \\ \Delta z
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma &amp; \gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
\gamma\beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \phantom{/}\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \phantom{/}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta t^\prime \\ \Delta x^\prime \\ \Delta y^\prime \\ \Delta z^\prime
\end{bmatrix}\]</span> but are more compact, the index notation offers more flexibility for defining the sums than matrix notation, flexibility that we will need in general relativity. But with the matrix equivalent in mind, you can easily show that the inverse is really an inverse: <span class="math display">\[\Delta x^{\mu} = (\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu} (\Lambda^{\nu}_{\alpha} \Delta x^{\alpha})
\quad \text{which in turn implies that} \quad
(\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\nu}\Lambda^{\nu}_{\alpha} = \delta^{\mu}_{\alpha}\]</span></p>
<p>where the <strong>Kronecker delta</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{\mu}_{\alpha}\)</span> is defined to be 1 when <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \alpha\)</span> and 0 otherwise, making it the index-notation equivalent to the identity matrix.</p>
<p>We can write the metric equation in a similarly compact form if we define a matrix object called the <strong>metric tensor</strong> to be <span class="math display">\[\eta_{\mu\nu} \equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \phantom{/} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \phantom{/}\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \phantom{/}
\end{bmatrix}\]</span> We can then write the metric equation using index notation simply as <span class="math display">\[\Delta s^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu} \Delta x^{\mu} \Delta x^{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>One might consider this overkill for such a simple equation, but we will see this to be essential in general relativity.</p>

<h2 id="four-vectors">Four-Vectors</h2>
<p>Now, just as we can consider the set of coordinate differences <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x, \Delta y, \text{and} \Delta z\)</span> to be the three components of a an ordinary displacement vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\vec{r}\)</span>, we can consider the set of coordinate differences <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t, \Delta x, \Delta y,
\text{and} \Delta z\)</span> to be the four components of a <strong>four-displacement</strong> vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\Delta s}\)</span>. Indeed, we can <em>define</em> an arbitrary <strong>four-vector</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> to be any set of four components <span class="math inline">\(A^t, A^x, A^y, A^z\)</span> that transform in the same way that the components of the four-displacement do: <span class="math display">\[A&#39;^{\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} A^{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>(Note that it is conventional to use a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{bold\;italic\;sans\text{-}serif}\)</span> font for four-vector symbols.) For the same mathematical reason that the squared spacetime separation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu} \Delta x^{\mu} \Delta x^{\nu}\)</span> is a frame-independent combination of the components of the four-displacement <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\Delta s}\)</span>, the squared magnitude <span class="math display">\[A^2 \equiv \eta_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu} A^{\nu} \equiv \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}\]</span></p>
<p>of the four-vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is also a frame-independent number.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important four-vector for our future purposes is the <strong>four-velocity</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> of a particle, whose components we define (in index notation) to be <span class="math display">\[u^\alpha \equiv \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\]</span> Since the differential proper time <span class="math inline">\(d\tau\)</span> between infinitesimally separated events along any world-line is frame independent, the ratio <span class="math inline">\(dx^\alpha/d\tau\)</span> must transform as its numerator does, and since the numerator is a differential four-displacement component; it (and thus the whole ratio) transforms as the components of a four-vector should when we change the reference frames. The frame-independent squared magnitude of this four-vector is <span class="math display">\[u \cdot u = \eta_{\mu\nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} = \frac{\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}}{d\tau^2} = \frac{-d\tau^2}{d\tau^2} = -1\]</span> <span class="math display">\[u \cdot u = \eta_{\mu\nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} = \frac{\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}}{d\tau^2} = \frac{-d\tau^2}{d\tau^2} = -1\]</span></p>
<p>by the definition of <span class="math inline">\(d\tau\)</span>. In a coordinate system where the particle’s ordinary speed is <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, note that <span class="math display">\[d\tau = \sqrt{dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2}
= dt\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2-
\left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} = dt\sqrt{1-v^2}\]</span> so the components of the four-vector are <span class="math display">\[u^t = \frac{dt}{d\tau} = \frac{dt}{dt\sqrt{1-v^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}, \quad
u^x = \frac{dx}{d\tau} = \frac{dx}{dt\sqrt{1-v^2}} = \frac{v_x}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}\]</span> and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(u^y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u^z\)</span>. Note that for low speeds, <span class="math inline">\(u^t \rightarrow 1\)</span> and the spatial components become approximately equal to the components of the particle’s ordinary velocity. In a frame where the particle is at rest, we have strictly <span class="math inline">\(u^t = 1, u^x = u^y = u^z = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another important four vector is a particle’s <strong>four-momentum</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>, defined as <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{u} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
p^{\alpha} = mu^{\alpha} = m\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\mathbf{p \cdot p} = m^2(\mathbf{u \cdot u}) = m^2(-1) = -m^2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the particle’s frame-independent <em>mass</em> (rest-energy). The time component of this vector in a given frame is the particle’s relativistic energy <span class="math inline">\(E \equiv m/\sqrt{1-v^2}\)</span> in that frame, while its spatial components are the components of its relativistic momentum 3-vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p} \equiv m\vec{v}/\sqrt{1-v^2}\)</span>.</p>
